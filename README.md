CHANGELIST:
version 0.9 (21.11.2019) - first release, testing.

This is a small script that will download Airbnb base config for ESLint, create .gitignore and .eslintrc.js to your project folder. Optionally it can download template for Jasmine tester (Firstly you need to tnstall Homebrew and wget for installing  tester template on Mac).

It can be called by entering this command in the root of your project:

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilya-mikhaylov/project-init/master/init.sh)
```

Current version is tested on Ubuntu 19.10. Don't forget to setup ESLint in your IDE correctly first.
Feel free to contact and maintain this small project and don't forget to report issues.

Plans: Add an alias for bash, Mac testing, Windows version.
